              Machine Learning, and possess the zeal to explore Full stack
              development. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology in
              Computer Science and Engineering from Netaji Subhash Engineering

              development(using Javascript/ReactJS/NodeJS and some other
              libraries and frameworks) and Machine Learning using Python (A
              good grasp of Analysis) and looking forward to learn and work on
              many more cool technologies. I love to portray the world in a
              frame with my tech skills and sometimes escape to the world of
              books. Canâ€™t restrain me from capturing the eyeful even though
